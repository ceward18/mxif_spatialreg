For more information on NIMBLE and a User Manual,
please visit https://R-nimble.org.

Note for advanced users who have written their own MCMC samplers:
  As of version 0.13.0, NIMBLE's protocol for handling posterior
  predictive nodes has changed in a way that could affect user-defined
  samplers in some situations. Please see Section 15.5.1 of the User Manual.
