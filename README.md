# mxif_spatialreg

This repository contains code associated with the simulation study presented in "Scalable Inference for Spatial Generalized Mixed Models for use in Multiplexed Imaging Analysis" by Ward et al. (2025).

The provided code implements the proposed eigen-decomposition approach for fitting the spatial GLMM for co-localization, as well as the SPDE approximation using R-INLA.
